# Team 'A' group Project - Car Parts Shop
Our project idea is a car parts shop based in Ireland. Our business aims to provide simple and affordable car parts across our numerous locations to both businesses, mechanics and car owners alike. Our business plans to make the process of ordering and shipping required parts easy for everyone. With our website allowing a user to easily enter all the relevant information needed for a simple delivery process while mantaining contact throughout the process letting customers know when their packages are to arrive. Our website will allow users to not only search for the part they require but also see which of our locations hold the part and quantities of each product.
